# Migration Guide v0.6 -> v0.7

ðŸŽ† Hanabi v0.7 marks an important milestone for the project: the addition of a generic expression-based API to enable complete customizing of the visual effects by the user.

The _Expression API_ departs radically from the previous version where the behavior of a particle was exclusively hard-coded into modifiers without any possibility to customize that behavior. Now, modifiers can leverage the Expression API to allow the user to provide a generic _expressions_ for any of their input value, rendering those modifiers completely under the control of the user.

This guide helps the user migrate from the pre-Expression v0.6 to the new Expression-based v0.7 of ðŸŽ† Hanabi. Users are encouraged to also read the [`CHANGELOG`](../CHANGELOG.md) for an exhaustive list of all changes.

## Understanding Expressions

An _expression_ is an object generating some WGSL shader code to produce a value at runtime when the shader is executed on the GPU. For example, `5.` is a literal (constant) expression, whose value is hard-coded and will never change. `max(x, y)` on the other hand produces a value equal to the maximum of two other values. Those two other values are themselves expressions; expressions combine together to form more complex expressions.

An expression is represented by the `Expr` enum. Expressions are stored into a `Module`, and referenced by an `ExprHandle`, a sort of index into the module's internal storage. Each `EffectAsset` owns a `Module` which stores all the `Expr` used by the modifiers associated with that `EffectAsset`.

Because `Module` and `Expr` are focusing on storage (serialization) and runtime execution, manipulating expressions directly can be verbose. The `ExprWriter` utility simplifies writing expressions by providing a concise syntax, operator overloading (_e.g._ `impl std::ops::Add`), and other helper methods which make writing new expressions shorter and clearer.

The typical workflow for the end user is as follow:

1. Call `ExprWriter::new()` to create a new expression writer. The new writer internally allocates a `Module`, that it'll use to store expressions as they're produced.
1. Build new expressions with the `ExprWriter` methods and the use of the associated `WriterExpr` type. A `WriterExpr` is very similar to an `ExprHandle`, but is more heavyweight at the benefit of allowing a more concise syntax and operator overloading. `WriterExpr` represents an intermediate expression, and should not be stored long term.
1. Finalize any expression with `WriterExpr::expr()`, writing the corresponding `Expr` into the underlying `Module` and recovering the associated `ExprHandle`.
1. Create a new modifier and assign the `ExprHandle` to one of its field.
1. Repeat until all modifiers are ready for a given `EffectAsset`.
1. Finish using the writer with `ExprWriter::finish()`, recovering the finalized `Module` containing all written `Expr`.
1. Create a new `EffectAsset` and assign that `Module` to it.

That last point is critical; expressions are owned by a `Module`, and assigning an `ExprHandle` from a different module produces undefined behaviors.

## Migrating modifiers

To migrate your modifiers from v0.6 to v0.7, you need to follow the steps above to prepare a `Module` with all the `Expr` describing the modifier inputs, then assign that module to the `EffectAsset` when you create it. Most examples have been migrated this way, and can be referenced for further details.

First, replace any `InitAgeModifier` and `InitLifetimeModifier` with an `InitAttributeModifer` built with the `Attribute::AGE` and `Attribute::LIFETIME`, respectively.

Then, follow the above steps to build expressions for all the modifier fields which were migrated to use `ExprHandle`. For example, an `AccelModifier::accel` field previously initialized with a constant:

// OLD

```rust
let asset = EffectAsset {
    // [...]
     ..Default::default()
}.update(AccelModifier::constant(Vec3::Y * -3.));
```

now requires building a literal expression instead:

// NEW

```rust
// Create an ExprWriter for convenience
let w = ExprWriter::new();

// Build the `accel` literal expression
let accel = w.lit(Vec3::Y * -3.);

// Write it down into the Module, and get back the ExprHandle
let expr = accel.expr();

// Repeat for other modifiers...
// [...]

// Finish using the ExprWriter and recover the Module
let module = w.finish();

// Finally, create the EffectAsset with the modifiers
let asset = EffectAsset {
    module,
    // [...]
     ..Default::default()
}.update(AccelModifier { accel: expr });
```

Note that previously a common pattern was to create modifiers inline while building the `EffectAsset`. This is not possible anymore for all modifiers using an `ExprHandle`, because the expression `Module` need to be finalized and assigned to the `EffectAsset` before the modifiers can be added to it. Otherwise the modifiers when they attach to the effect will fail their consistency check and panic.

## Other migration items

- All typed values like `graph::Value::Float3` need to be replaced by their scalar/vector counterpart:
  - `graph::Value::Float(f)` becomes `graph::Value::Scalar(ScalarValue::Float(f)))`
  - `graph::Value::Float3(v)` becomes `graph::Value::Vector(VectorValue::new_vec3(v))`
  - _etc._
  
  Some conversions are provided via `From<>` /  `Into<>`, which can make the syntax shorter in some cases.

- Same kind of conversions for `graph::ValueType`.

- Rename `SimParams::dt` into `SimParams::delta_time`, and any shader use of `dt` into `delta_time`.
